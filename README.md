### Details of Project

Here are some of the call metrics included in the dashboard:

- **Calls by Call Center:** This section shows the total number of calls received by each call center. Los Angeles received the most calls (13,734), followed by Baltimore (11,012), Chicago (10,639), and Denver (6,576).
- **Calls by Reason for Call:** This section shows the top three reasons for calls across all call centers: billing questions (25%), payments (23%), and service outages (20%).
- **Calls by State:** This section shows the number of calls received from each state. Unfortunately, the data for calls by state is cut off in the image.
- **Sentiment:** This section shows the sentiment of the calls (positive, neutral, very negative). Positive sentiment is highest for calls to Utah and Nablowa, while very negative sentiment is highest for calls to Dragon and Idaho. However, the call volume for very positive calls is much lower than the call volume for very negative calls.
- **Response Time:** This section shows how long it took to respond to calls. It appears that the call center met its service level agreement (SLA) for response time in October 2020.
- **Calls by Day:** This section is a calendar heat map showing the number of calls received each day of the month. Unfortunately, the data for calls by day is cut off in the image.

By examining key indicators such as total calls, reasons for calls, sentiment analysis, and response time, stakeholders can identify areas of success and opportunities for improvement within the call center operation. This dashboard serves as a valuable tool for understanding customer interactions and guiding strategic decision-making to enhance overall call center performance.
